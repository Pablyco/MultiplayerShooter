Multiplayer Shooter Game.


A modern multiplayer shooter developed in Unreal Engine 5.5. This project is based on an advanced online course, with significant updates and improvements made to align with the latest version of the engine.
It serves both as a learning experience and a showcase of my abilities as a gameplay programmer.

    -Codebase Refactored & Upgraded for Unreal 5.5 compatibility

Tech Stack:

    -Unreal Engine 5.5

    -C++ (Gameplay Programming)

    -Blueprints (UI & minor logic)

Purpose:
This project demonstrates my knowledge in multiplayer game architecture and gameplay programming. While it follows a course structure, Iâ€™ve extended and modernized the project with custom improvements and best practices.
